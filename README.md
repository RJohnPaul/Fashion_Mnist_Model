This py script utilizes TensorFlow to train a neural network for classifying images from Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of a set of 70,000 grayscale images categorized into 10 classes of clothing.

## Features

- Loading and displaying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- Normalizing pixel values to the range [0, 1].
- Building a simple neural network using TensorFlow's Sequential API.
- Compiling the model with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss.
- Training the model on the training set for 5 epochs.
- Evaluating the model's performance on the test set.
- Making predictions on the test set.

## Modules Used

- TensorFlow (`import tensorflow as tf`) - [TensorFlow Website](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- Matplotlib (`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`) - [Matplotlib Website](https://matplotlib.org/)
- 
## Demo
 - Try the code out live on Collab : [Demo](https://bit.ly/fashion_mod)
   
## Installation

Make sure you have TensorFlow and Matplotlib installed using the following commands:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Future Improvements

Possible enhancements and future improvements to the script include:

- Hyperparameter tuning for optimizing model performance.
- Experimenting with different neural network architectures.
- Implementing data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- Visualizing model performance metrics and training progress.
